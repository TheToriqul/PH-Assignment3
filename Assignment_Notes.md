# Assignment Notes to Instructor:

### I'd like to provide some additional context and clarifications:

1. **Installation**: I opted to install Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI directly rather than using their CDN. After completing the second module, I had some time to watch Learn with Sumit’s tutorials on Tailwind CSS. His free tutorials covered some advanced techniques that were quite helpful in preparing me for our third module.

2. **Responsiveness**: The site is designed to be responsive across both mobile and desktop views. I utilized Tailwind CSS’s responsive utilities, including DaisyUI, to ensure proper display on various screen sizes.

3. **Accessibility**: I have made an effort to adhere to good accessibility practices throughout the site.

4. **Responsive Navigation**: The navigation adapts to different screen sizes, featuring a hamburger menu for mobile views.

5. **README**: The README file was adapted from a previous project of mine; I copied it over and made the necessary modifications.

I welcome any feedback on areas where I can improve or expand my skills. Thank you for your time and consideration.
