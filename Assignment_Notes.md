# ASSIGNMENT-Notes to Instructor:

### I'd like to provide some additional context and clarifications:

1. Installation: I have installed tailwind and daisyUI instead of using their CDN.

2. Responsiveness: The site is designed to be responsive across mobile, and desktop views. I've used Tailwind CSS's responsive utilities (DaisyUI) to achieve this.

3. Accessibility: While I've tried to maintain good accessibility practices.

4. Responsive Navigation: The navigation adapts for different screen sizes, with a hamburger menu for mobile views.

5. README: Readme I added from my previous own project, just copy paste and modified.

I welcome any feedback on areas where I can improve or expand my skills. Thank you for your time and consideration.
